#  Short description:
how much do you exercise
Or are you in trouble?
How many did you count to remember?
My new project is a counter with a dark theme.
Simple and attractive.
This is my first JavaScript project.
That's why I like it so much that I want you to try it first.


# How Do i Work
what a good question
I said to ask myself this question before you.
I consisted of three buttons.
Increase button, decrease button and reset button.
The reset button resets you to zero.
And by clicking on the rest of the buttons, your number will increase or decrease by one unit :)
If you click on the increase button, the color of your number will be green, and if you click on the decrease button, the color of the sixth button will be red, and my reset color will be yellow.
Let's go see how I am ?


> Count with me!
My counter says:
Leave your calculations to me :)
He likes to be useful to everyone.
